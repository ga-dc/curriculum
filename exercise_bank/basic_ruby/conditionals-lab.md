# Exercise - HAMda Part 1: Temperature Converter

HAMco Global Enterprises, Inc, is on a roll lately, releasing products around
the world that have revolutionized dozens of industries. It's time to do it
again. So HAMco has come to you design our next hot product, HAMda (HAMco
Digital Assitant).

## Menu System

HAMco keeps up with the trends, and we know that 'retro' is the latest fad
among today's youth. So HAMda will use a text-based menu system, just like
software 20 years ago!

This means your program should print text to the screen, and prompt users to
enter choices. Whether the users enters numbers or letters is up to you!

To begin, build a menu system that supports choosing the following options:

* Convert temperatures
  * Fahrenheit to Celsius
  * Celsius to Fahrenheit
* Task Manager
* NSA Wiretap Request System

For now, after choosing an option (or sub-option), the program should tell the
user that the feature isn't implemented, and then re-display the menu.
