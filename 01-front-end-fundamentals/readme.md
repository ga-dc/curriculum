## Intro to the Web and HTML
- Diagram the relationship between a server and a browser, including responses and requests.
- Explain the difference between http:// and file://.
- Semantically structure a given document using HTML without regard to style.
- List commonly-abused HTML elements.

## The CLI (Command Line Interface)

### Concepts

- Compare and contrast CLIs / GUIs
- Explain how command line usage can increase efficiency
- Describe the anatomy of a command (statement, flags, arguments)
- Explain what a path is, and why the 'current path' is important in the CLI
- Explain the difference between an absolute path and a relative path

### Mechanics

- Setup your working directory / environment for WDI
- List common commands to
  - View the path of the current directory
  - View the contents of a directory
  - Navigate to different directories
  - Manage files and directories
- Open files and directories with Atom
- List unsafe commands

## Intro to Git

### Conceptual

- Explain what version control is and why developers use it
- List the main components of a git repository and how they relate:
  - repo, working tree, index (aka staging area), commit
- Describe what a git remote repository is.
- Differentiate between git as a tool, and github as a service
- Define and differentiate between forking and cloning

### Mechanical
- Initialize a local git repository
- Add and commit changes to a git repository
- Add a remote repository, and push/pull changes to that remote
- Use the 'fork, clone, and pull request' model to submit assignments
- Un-initialize a git repository

## Intro to CSS
- Construct a CSS rule using selectors, declarations, properties, and values
- Articulate the pros and cons of stylesheets, styles in the head, and in-line styles
- Define "cascading" in the context of CSS specificity
- Style the size, color, border, text, and font of all elements of a given tag on a page
- Demonstrate the use of class and ID selectors to target specific element(s)
- Distinguish between block and inline display values
- Identify the components of the box model
- Differentiate between the border-box and content-box values for box-sizing
- Apply knowledge of the box model to adjust spacing between and around elements on a page

## JS Data Types, Loops, and Conditionals
- Describe the role Javascript plays alongside HTML and CSS.
- List and describe the primitive data types.
- Describe uses of mathematical operators in Javascript.
- Define type coercion.
- Define and use complex data types.
- Explain the difference between `prompt` and `console.log`
- Practice proper JS syntax and semantic variable naming.
- Differentiate between true & false && truthy & falsey
- Describe why control flow is utilized in computer programming
- Write an if, else if, and else statement in JS
- Write a for loop and while loop in JS and differentiate between them
- Utilize loops to iterate through complex data types

## JS Objects and Functions

### Objects
- Compare objects and key-value stores to arrays as data structures.
- Explain the difference between object properties and methods.
- Create objects using object literal syntax.
- Compare adding and retrieving properties to objects using dot and bracket notation.
- Use `delete`.
- Iterate over the keys of an object to return and manipulate values.
- Explain nested data structures.
- Write an object method.

### Functions
- Describe what a JavaScript function is.
- Recognize the parts of a function.
- Write a function in JavaScript using a declaration and an expression.
- Define hoisting.
- Differentiate between referencing and invoking a function.
- State the difference between a function's output and side effects.

## JS DOM and Debugging

### The Document Object Model (DOM)

- Explain what the DOM is and how it is structured
- Select and target DOM elements using DOM methods
- Select and target DOM elements using a query selector
- Create, read, update, and delete DOM elements
- Change the attributes or content of a DOM element

### Debugging

- Identify and resolve common and uncommon "logical errors" that affect the results of your program
- Use logs to troubleshoot errors in an application (console log in Dev Tools)
- Conduct real-time debugging in the browser (start small, triangulation, remove code)
- Access properties of a class using helper methods ( `typeof( )` for datatypes)
- Use debuggers and breakpoints to identify logical errors in expressions
