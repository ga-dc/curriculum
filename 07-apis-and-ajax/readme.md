### APIs
- Describe what an API is, and why we might use one.
- Explain the common role of JSON on the web.
- Describe the purpose and syntax of `respond_to`

### Grid Systems
- Explain the benefits of using CSS grids in web design.
- Identify the basic components of a grid.
- Review float, clearfix and other CSS properties.
- Build a grid from scratch.
- Use nested columns in a grid.
- Examine how grids are utilized in a front-end framework (e.g., Bootstrap).

### Ajax
- Explain the difference between synchronous and asynchronous program execution
- Explain why synchronous program execution is not conducive to the front-end.
- Use jQuery `$.ajax()` method to make asynchronous GET requests for data.
- Distinguish between a callback and a promise.
- Use jQuery's 'promise-like' methods to handle AJAX responses asynchronously.
- Render new HTML content using data loaded from an Ajax request.
- Perform POST, PUT, and DELETE requests to an API to modify data.

### Responsive Web Design

- Use media queries to adjust styles for different viewport sizes.
- Explain the difference between a responsive website and a mobile-specific website.
- Identify and use relative units like `em`, `rem`, `vh`, `vw`, etc..
- List the different media query values and their conditions.
- Use the iOS simulator, Safari console, and Chrome Dev tools to debug responsive CSS.
- Compare mobile-first to desktop-first responsive design

### CSS Transitions & Animations

- Describe what it means to transition or animate in CSS
- List the types of properties that can / can't be animated
- Use the `transition` declaration to change element properties on events
- Describe the purpose and syntax of css `keyframes`
- List and describe the purpose of the `animation` properties
- Describe the importance of prefixing CSS properties
- Compare & contrast CSS Transitions and Animations
- Create complex animations using CSS animation properties
- Compare & contrast using CSS and JS for animations
