.gitignore
----------

Add a .gitignore file to ignore files you want to exclude from your repository. You can include specific files (e.g., password.txt, though don't actually store passwords that way), or a category of files (like ._\* for thumbnail files of photos), or a directory (tmp/\*).

github has a [good list](https://github.com/github/gitignore) of example .gitignore files
