# Git Tricks

*Add your tricks below this line*
If you create a file in your repository named .gitignore, Git uses it to determine which files and directories to ignore, before you make a commit. Also, a .gitignore file should be committed into your repository, in order to share the ignore rules with any other users that clone the repository.

GitHub maintains an official list of recommended .gitignore files for many popular operating systems, environments, and languages in the github/gitignore public repository.
