## Opening Framing (3 min)

Wouldn't it be nice to make our webpages look schnazzy? Enter CSS. There is such a wide breadth of things to learn about CSS and honestly, you could probably teach a whole 12 weeks to understand all the capabilities, nuances and subtleties. So we'll only be scratching the surface with it, but I encourage you to experiment with CSS on your own. As you consistently use CSS you realize, while frustrating, becomes awesome to utilize.

## In-line vs head vs stylesheets(30m) *Not a codealong let class know they're welcome to but may be better just to pay attention to the first hour instead of typing everything out. All notes available in lesson plan*

At the crux of it all, the primary concept of CSS is to select an HTML element and then do something to it. IE. I want to take the body element, and I want to apply a background color to it.

Let's get started by creating a new html webpage that we'll call `index.html` in some working directory of your choosing:

```bash
$ touch index.html
```

Let's throw some dummy content into HTML inside our `index.html`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <title>CSS!</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hello world!</h1>
  <p>This is some fake dummy content. It doesn't matter what it is! Whatever you want! Smelly fish create beautiful works of art in order to achieve world peace.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

*Whiteboard definitions as they come up*

So one way we can style elements in HTML is in the tag itself. These are called inline-styles:

```html
<p style="background:blue"></p>
```
> note the above is a declaration. A declaration is a property and a value.

Blech even just writing this out feels miserable. Why do you guys think I feel miserable about this?

### T & T (3m)
Knowing not too much about coding. Take a couple minutes and chat with your partner about why this particular way of styling an element might not be the greatest approach?

> Don't use inline styles if you can avoid it

The next approach to implementing a style is to put the styling in the `<head>`:

```html
<head>
  <title>CSS!</title>
  <style>
    p {
      background: blue
    }
  </style>
</head>
```
> You've seen this before, but I want to highlight some syntax here. The p in this code is what's called the selector. The background  in the code is the property. Finally blue is the value.

This is a bit better. I feel less dirty. But feel weird about this one too. Why might that be? (ST-WG)


What's the best way? External stylesheets! Let's create a new file called `styles.css`:

```bash
$ touch styles.css
```

In our `index.html` let's go ahead and link to that stylesheet in the `<head>`:

```html
<head>
  <title>CSS!</title>
  <link rel='stylesheet' href='styles.css'>
</head>
```

In `styles.css`:
```css
p{
  background:blue;
}
```

Ahh, much bettah. You might be asking yourself, but Andy? that seems like a lot more work. And you might be right initially. But we're talking about 1 `<p>` right now. What if we're talking about 100 `<p>`'s and now those elements were spread across multiple web pages. Now all of a sudden this last method is less work.

## CSS Selectors(10m)
As you can see, there's more than one place to target elements. There's also multiple WAYS you can target elements. Let's throw some additional content in `index.html`:

```html
<body>
  <h1>Hello world!</h1>
  <p>This is some fake dummy content. It doesn't matter what it is! Whatever you want! Smelly fish create beautiful works of art in order to achieve world peace.</p>
  <p class="red">This paragraph tag element has a class of "red"</p>
  <p class="red" id="green">This paragraph tag element has an id of "green"</p>
  <div class="red">This div tag element has a class of "red"</div>
</body>
```

All I did here was add two `<p>` elements and added a class of "red" to both and an id of "green" to the last. Additionally I added a `<div>` element with a class of red.

The first thing I want to do is make it so all elements with the class of "red" has a background of red. In our `styles.css`:

```css
.red {
  background: red;
}
```

Awesome, but I think I want just the `<p>` elements with that class name to have a background of red. So in `styles.css`:

```css
p.red{
  background: red;
}
```

Finally to select an element with an id you use `#`. I'm going to change the background color of the p element with class "green" in our `styles.css`:

```css
#green{
  background: green;
}
```

*whiteboard common selectors as well as let them know about references at the bottom of the page*

## CSS Specificity (20m)
If I change the css selector from `p.red` back to `.red` you'll notice that the paragraph element with the id of green is still green. This is because of CSS Specificity. While CSS cascades from top to bottom. The CSS that is applied depends on Specificity as well. Take the following example:

```css
#green {
  background: green;
}
.red {
  background: blue;
}

.red {
  background: red;
}
```

In this example the elements that have the class red, will ultimately have a background of red even though blue was set first because it takes the last declared property. However, even though the `#green` selector was written first, it has a higher specificity and therefore overides the following background properties.

The following list of selector types is by increasing specificity:

- Universal selectors (e.g., '\*')
- Type selectors (e.g., h1)
- Class selectors (e.g., .example)
- Attributes selectors (e.g., [type="radio"])
- Pseudo-classes (e.g., :hover)
- ID selectors (e.g., #example)
- Inline style (e.g., style="font-weight:bold")

## The Box Model!(15m)
> One of the tricky things about CSS at first is the Box Model. But it's actually really simple. Let's break it down.

Any HTML element can be considered a box, and so the box model applies to all HTML elements. If you select an element prescribe it a height and width, the content itself will be that height and width.

What the size doesn't include:
- padding
- border
- margin

Let's go into our existing `index.html` and `styles.css` and add some stuff to illustrate what I mean. In `index.html`:

```html
<p>This is a paragraph</p>
<p class="padding">This is a paragraph</p>
```

In `styles.css`:

```css
p {
  background: red;
  height: 100px;
  width: 20%;
}
```

Lets check this out in our chrome browser with the developer tools. As you can see, everything is identical. Which makes sense. Let's go ahead and add some padding to the html element with class "padding". In `styles.css`:

```css
p {
  background: red;
  height: 100px;
  width: 20%;
}

p.padding {
  padding:10px;
}
```

> Well that's certainly interesting. Even though the dimensions are the same. The element with padding is larger.

Let go ahead and add `margin: 10px;` and `border: 10px solid black;` to the padding class as well. Let's inspect that element in the browser and you can see Chrome's clear depiction of content, padding, border and margin.

All these different sizings can be confusing. This can especially be frustrating when you think something's 20 % when in actuality it isn't.  Enter box-sizing.

At the top of our `styles.css`:

```css
* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

Now when we refresh, all of our 20% widths are the same regardless of padding. It also includes border! However, it does not include the margin.

## CSS Properties and values
Man, there's alot of them. We've seen many just in this lesson thus far. There are far more than I can cover. Additionally, there's just no way to know them all. Unless you're a CSS savant. Fortunately, there are some great references. Here's just a few!
